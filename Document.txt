Project is divided into frontend , backend and devops (Related pictures are uploaded to Pictures folder)

Backend : Implemented the required routes with python using fastapi ,
framework after reading many articles its similary to express framework so used it 
and for data layer I used postgres , used supabase db while development and switched to postgres 
stateful set in eks

Running the service : 
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Frontend : 
Implemented mainly 4 pages to visually our backend , homepage for routing , get message by id page 
create page and search page , deployed into s3 and eks as well , just for my testing , you can find
two jenkinsfile for frontend , one will deploy it into s3 , one will deploy it into eks 

Running the service: 
cd Frontend/app
npm install 
npm start

Devops : 

Terraform : used terraform to create the whole infra which consists of vpc , eks and jenkins server
Used the modules provided by terraform , other wise we write our own and tell the path in source
written one module for example 

After creating aws infrastruture ---> I installed fluxcd in eks , Flux Entry Point : Devops/clusters/plivo
So All the resources mentioned in the entrypoint , flux takes them as single source of truth and 
sync them into cluster 

if we have multiple cluster then it will be easy for us to use overlays and base folders and we would we have 
version control as well with flux 

Mainly I have used two folder to sync repo with eks 
1.argo-applications (for microservcices)(added this for having ui so it will easier to maintain them )
2.infrastruture (for normal services)
Has everything that is needed , I installed everything using helmrelease , we can change the values and
flux will sync them 

infrastruture contains argocd , aws alb controller , monitoring , ingress resources , network policies etc

For monitoring I used prometheus , fluentd as Deamonset , elastic search for log storage and added them as 
datasources in grafana with local dns name without exposing them and exposed grafana .

Currently as we dont many microservcices , I did not add istio , I thought it may slow the 
existing infrastruture as they  increase memory and cpu very much 

Jenkinsfile are in CI/CD folder

Used Sonarqube , trivy , docker for building and testing and argo for microservices continous delivery

The argocd applications are installed in declarative way and I kept them in sync with k8-manifests folder 

Used helmcharts for backend service and added normal files for frontend service 

applications have deployment containing replicaset , pods used rolling update strategy with HPA (with average metrics), Pod Disruption
budget , Added pod security to run them as nonroot users , added one network policy so that pods in application namespace
cant talk to other namespace ,we can node anti-affinity for high available service .

Exposed microservcices with ingress resource (to expose services to internet) with path based routing(added all routes in single resource)


Setting up infra : 
create eks and install flux to sync the folder(Devops/clusters/Plivo)

**  Destroyed the infrastructure to make this repo public , Pictures are placed in pictures folder for reference 

Thank you sir
